# Music Genre Classification Deep Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to classify music genres using deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The classification model is built using Python, Flask, and LSTM architecture.

## Features
- Music genre classification using LSTM neural networks.
- Web interface for uploading audio files and predicting their genres.
- Support for multiple music genres.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Music-Genre-Classification-Deep-Learning
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Access the web interface in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Upload an audio file and click on the predict button to classify its genre.
